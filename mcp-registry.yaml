# Analysis

**Language and Runtime Environment:**  
Node.js (requires Node.js 18+). The repository contains a `package.json` with `"type": "module"`, source code must be built (`npm run build`), and the main entry point for CLI is `cli.js`. There is _no evidence the package is published on npm as `browser-mcp`_, so this is a **local/unpublished Node.js project**.

**Dependencies and Configuration:**  
Critical configuration is the `ANCHOR_API_KEY` (required), which must be passed as an environment variable (see both README and CLI error message). Optional parameters are `--host` and `--port` (but not strictly required; defaults are used if omitted).

**Build Requirements:**  
- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Build: `npm run build`

**Entry Point:**  
- Execute with: `node cli.js`
- So the run command, after build, should be: `node cli.js`

# Assumptions

- **Not published on npm**; so must be built and executed locally.
- Build output (for `.js` files) lands in project root or `lib/`, but README and "bin" point to `cli.js` (not in a `dist/` or `lib/` directory). So `cli.js` is directly executable after build.
- Require only `ANCHOR_API_KEY` as configuration.
- No additional configuration fields are strictly required. Host and port can be added as advanced options if needed by the user.
- Bin entry is `cli.js` (not in a subfolder).

# Usage Notes

- **Local build required:** The package is not published on npm and must be built locally each time. The registry command does all steps: install, build, and then execution with provided API key.
- **Configuration:** You must provide a valid Anchor Browser API key.
- **No host/port needed for typical use.** Add as advanced options if you wish (can be appended to args via UI or future schema).
- **For different entry points or production Docker use, you may specify additional args, e.g. `--port 8931 --host 0.0.0.0`.
